## Docker ##
1. How to monitor container and know which container will show exact utilization
	=> # docker stats [container_name]
	   # docker inspect [container_name]

2. How to troubleshoot memory leak issue in container
	=> Monitor Container Memory Usage, Check Container Logs [ # docker logs [container_name] ], Inspect Running Processes 
		[ # docker exec -it [container_name] sh
			top ]
	
3. What is UFS [ Union File System ]? 
	=> a popular Union File System is OverlayFS (Overlay File System). OverlayFS is often used in conjunction with Docker and 
		other containerization technologies. It allows you to layer multiple file systems on top of each other, typically a 
		read-only base layer (like an official Docker image) and a read-write upper layer (container-specific changes).
4. What is COW ?
	=> Copy-On-Write (COW):
		OverlayFS uses a copy-on-write strategy. When a file is modified, instead of modifying the original file, a new copy 
		 is created in the upper layer. This ensures that changes made in the container do not affect the original image.
		 
5. What is difference between COPY & ADD
	=> ADD can handle URLs and automatically extract compressed archives during the copy, whereas COPY only copies files or 
		directories from the local file system.
	
6. How docker build image
	=> # docker build -t your-image-name .

7. What is RUN, CMD & ENTRYPOINT in dockerfile & its periority ?
	=> RUN : The RUN instruction is used to execute commands during the image build. It is primarily used for installing 
			 packages, updating software, downloading dependencies, and other tasks that are part of the image creation process. 
			 Each RUN instruction creates a new layer in the Docker image.
	   CMD : The CMD instruction provides the default command to run when a container is started. It can be overridden by 
			 specifying a command when running the container. If a Dockerfile has multiple CMD instructions, only the last one 
			 will take effect.
	   ENTRYPOINT : The ENTRYPOINT instruction configures a container that will run as an executable. It is often used to 
			 define a container as an executable script or application. Like CMD, it can be overridden by providing a command 
			 when running the container. If both CMD and ENTRYPOINT are specified, the command specified in CMD will be passed 
			 as arguments to the command specified in ENTRYPOINT.		 
			 
8. Explain Docker network
	=> 1. Bridge Network: When you install Docker, it creates a default network bridge named bridge. By default, containers 
			are attached to this bridge network.
	   2. Host Network: By using the host network mode, a container shares the network namespace with the Docker host. 
						It directly uses the network stack of the host, which can be useful for achieving better performance.
	   3. Overlay Networks: In Docker Swarm mode (container orchestration), overlay networks are used to connect containers 
				across multiple nodes in a cluster. Overlay networks enable seamless communication between containers running 
				on different hosts.
