itw-01: T-Systems ICT India Pvt. Ltd

Q.1: brief yourself

Q.1.1: hav u work on Kubernates?

no sir. I did not get chance to work. only senior members handling that.

Q.2: How do u execute jenkin pipeline?

I have explained DWN-01\Q.085\project-01. I told we start build at 10PM. then he asks, if developer want immediate result, then?

I answer, we have to use webhook.

what other types of execution?

poll scm, build periodically, webhook, upstream, downstream.

what is difference between them?

Q.3: what do you used to build code?

maven

Q.4: what command in maven?

mvn clean install

Q.5 what it does?

maven has lifecycle, verify, compile, test, package, integration test, build, deploy

with mvn clean install, it executes all this thing.

Q.6: If I want to do only integration test, then how I can do?

not able to answer.

Q.7: what deploy do?

not able to answer.

Q.8: As you told, you have use docker container, what are commands you have used docker file?

FROM, COPY

Q.9: what other commands?

WORKDIR, RUN, ADD

can u write command to enter in container in chat box?

docker ps for getting container id

docker attach container id

docker exec -it container id bash

Q.10: What command to make text file using docker commands?

not able to answer.

Q.10: I made container, I written txt file. How can I copy that that container & see that text file?

no answer.

This means, duplicate of container.

> docker container ls
                                                                                                                         
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE   COMMAND  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS  NAMES
c5a24953e383  gradle  "bash"   22 minutes ago  Up 22 minutes  #      naughty_torvalds
 

In above images, I have container ID “c5a24953e383”. I have to duplicate this container.

we can create a new image from that container using the docker commit command:

docker commit c5a24953e383 newimagename

And then start a new container from that image:

docker run -d newimagename

 

docker commit practical is in aws_practical\Q.40.02

Q.11: what docker compose do?

run multiple container & treat everything as service.

Q.12: If I have 2 container made using docker compose, how can I run one container after another using docker compose?

12.1:

Start a single service:

 

$ docker-compose up <service_name>

Stop a single service:

$ docker-compose stop <service_name>

Restart a single service:

$ docker-compose restart <service_name>

Build a single service:

$ docker-compose build <service_name>

 

For example, the following example will determine whether mysql has been started, if it is started, execute catalina.sh run

>wait-for-it.sh host_name : 3306 -- catalina.sh run

 

The following introduces the use of command instruction + wait-for-it script to do startup dependency

Q.13: u have written route 53? what do you know about it?

route 53 do DNS management. we are hiding actual details using CNAME. if we buy swapnilbhole.com & my EC2 IP is 1.2.3.4, then 1.2.3.4 is link to swapnilbhole.com. Now, if I have support.swapnilbhole.com or help.swapnilbhole.com. In this way, we are hiding actual data with CNAME.

we have 21 days of 1 scrum. 21 days means actual 15 working days. In sprint planning, all team member task are getting assign. Then we have daily scrum meeting at 10AM. In this, we have to explain, what we did yesterday & what we are going to do today. We have to update jira ticket & timesheet as per assign task.  We have client meeting on Wednesday. In client meeting, we don’t have permission to talk, but, it is mandatory to join meeting to understand overall project status.

we have retrospective meeting after scrum ending. In this, we discuss, what goes right, what goes wrong, what are improvement needs to do.

Q.18: do u have any question for me?

sir, if I got opportunity to work. what services & tools, I need to work.

he explains, aws services grafana, lambda, python for automation, Kubernates & cutting edge tools.

Q.19: any other questions?

sir, that docker files how to run automatically.

he told, u can google search.

any other question?

no sir.
